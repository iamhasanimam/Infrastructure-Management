# RDGW01 – Remote Desktop Gateway 

- **Hostname**: RDGW01  
- **IP Address**:  
  - Internal: `192.168.0.1`  
  - Public: `138.x.x.x`  
- **Roles**: Remote Desktop Gateway, NAT Router, RDP Reverse Proxy  
- **Domain**: `infra.local` (joined)

## 🔹 Step 1: Rename and Join Domain

### Rename:
- Open `sysdm.cpl`
- Set computer name to `RDGW01`
- Restart

### Join Domain:
- After reboot, go to:
  - System → Change Settings → Domain: `infra.local`
- Use credentials for domain join (e.g. `infra\domainadmin`)
- Reboot again

## 🔹 Step 2: Assign Static IPs (Dual NIC Configuration)

### Internal NIC:

| Setting         | Value         |
|----------------|---------------|
| IP Address      | 192.168.0.1   |
| Subnet Mask     | 255.255.255.0 |
| Default Gateway | (leave blank) |
| Preferred DNS   | 192.168.0.3   |

### Public NIC:

| Setting         | Value              |
|----------------|--------------------|
| IP Address      | 138.x.x.x          |
| Subnet Mask     | Provider-specific  |
| Default Gateway | Provider gateway   |
| Preferred DNS   | 8.8.8.8, 1.1.1.1   |

> Ensure internal NIC is at the top of binding order

```powershell
Get-NetAdapterBinding -ComponentID ms_tcpip6
```

## 🔹 Step 3: Install RD Gateway Role

### Using Server Manager:
- Add Roles and Features → Role-Based → RDGW01
- Check:
  - [x] Remote Desktop Services
  - [x] Remote Desktop Gateway
- Click Next → Install

### Using PowerShell:
```powershell
Install-WindowsFeature RDS-Gateway -IncludeManagementTools
```

## 🔹 Step 4: Configure Routing and Remote Access (NAT)

> This turns RDGW01 into a NAT router between public and internal networks

### Steps:
1. Open **Server Manager** → Tools → **Routing and Remote Access**
2. Right-click RDGW01 → Configure and Enable Routing
3. Select: **Network Address Translation (NAT)**
4. Select **Public interface** (your 138.x.x.x NIC)
5. Enable NAT on it
6. Add internal NIC as **private interface**

### Confirm NAT works:
```powershell
Get-NetNat
Get-NetRoute
```

## 🔹 Step 5: Configure RD Gateway Policies

### Open: **Remote Desktop Gateway Manager**
1. Create a **Connection Authorization Policy (CAP)**:
   - Allow domain users
   - Use password authentication

2. Create a **Resource Authorization Policy (RAP)**:
   - Allow access to internal RDS hosts: `RDS01`, `RDS02`, `DEDICATED01`


## 🔹 Step 6: Bind SSL Certificate for RD Gateway

### Steps:
- Open RD Gateway Manager
- Right-click RDGW01 → Properties → SSL Certificate Tab
- Choose:
  - Use a self-signed cert (test)
  - Or import a public cert with Common Name: `rdgw01.infra.local` or public DNS name

> Optionally generate a self-signed cert:
```powershell
New-SelfSignedCertificate -DnsName "rdgw01.infra.local" -CertStoreLocation "cert:\LocalMachine\My"
```

## 🔹 Step 7: Test External RDP Connection

### From external client:
- Open `mstsc.exe`
- Go to `Advanced → Settings...`
- Enable Gateway:
  - RD Gateway server: `138.x.x.x` or `rdgw01.infra.local`

### Remote Computer:
- Example: `rds01.infra.local` or `rdfarm.infra.local`

> 🔐 RDGW01 will:
> - Accept the HTTPS RDP connection on 443
> - Internally initiate RDP to RDS01 or RDS farm (RDCB01)
> - If connecting to a farm, will forward session to RDCB01
> - RDCB01 decides which session host to use
> - RDGW01 then opens final TCP 3389 to that RDS host (e.g., RDS02)

## 🔹 Step 8: Validate NAT for Outbound Internet (Optional)

### From internal VMs (like RDS01, DC01):
- Try accessing internet (e.g. ping 8.8.8.8 or browse site)

### On RDGW01:
- Check NAT session table:
```powershell
Get-NetNatSession
```

> Confirm packets are being NAT’d through RDGW01's public NIC.

## ✅ Final Outcome

- RDGW01 now allows **secure, encrypted RDP** access from the internet to internal-only servers
- NAT routing enables internet access for internal VMs
- Session redirection via RDCB01 is handled transparently
- Gateway policies + SSL + AD integration = enterprise-grade hardened access
