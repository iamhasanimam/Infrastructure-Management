 RD Gateway (RDGW01) Setup – Full GUI Steps (with Domain Join)
✅ Step 1: Set Static IP on Internal NIC (192.168.0.6)
Open Network Connections
→ Control Panel > Network and Sharing > Change adapter settings

Right-click Internal NIC (vSwitch1) → Properties → Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)

Set:

IP: 192.168.0.6

Subnet: 255.255.255.0

Gateway: (leave blank)

DNS: 192.168.0.5 (DC01)

⚠️ Don't set a gateway here. Only set DNS to point to the domain controller.

✅ Step 2: Join RDGW01 to Domain (infra.local)
Right-click This PC → Properties

Click Rename this PC (advanced) or "Change Settings"

Click Change…

Select Domain

Enter: infra.local

Enter domain admin credentials when prompted (e.g., infra\Administrator)

Restart the machine when asked

🔄 After reboot, login using: infra\Administrator

✅ Step 3: Rename Computer (Optional)
Go to System Properties

Click Change…

Set Computer Name: RDGW01

Restart if changed

✅ Step 4: Install RD Gateway Role
Open Server Manager

Click Manage > Add Roles and Features

Choose:

Installation Type: Role-based or feature-based

Server: local machine

Under Roles:

Expand Remote Desktop Services

Check ✅ Remote Desktop Gateway

Click Next → Install

Reboot if required

✅ Step 5: Configure RD Gateway in GUI
Open:
Server Manager > Tools > Remote Desktop Gateway Manager

In RD Gateway Manager:

Right-click the RDGW server → Properties

🔐 Step 6: Add SSL Certificate
Go to the SSL Certificate tab

Click Import a certificate (or choose self-signed)

For now:

Use self-signed if no public cert available

Or generate via IIS if needed later

✅ Step 7: Create Authorization Policies
🟢 Connection Authorization Policy (RD-CAP)
In RD Gateway Manager → Expand server → Right-click Connection Authorization Policies → New

Name: AllowDomainUsers

Select:

User Groups → Add: Domain Users

Authentication Method: Password only

Finish → ✅ Policy Created

🟢 Resource Authorization Policy (RD-RAP)
Right-click Resource Authorization Policies → New

Name: AllowRDSAccess

Select:

User Groups: Domain Users

Network Resource Groups: Add RDS01, RDS02 (or infra.local\Computers)

Finish

🔧 Step 8: Enable Firewall Rules (Optional Manual Check)
Open Windows Defender Firewall > Advanced Settings

Inbound Rules:

Ensure Remote Desktop Gateway rules are enabled (port 443)

Ensure Remote Desktop - User Mode (TCP-In) is enabled (port 3389)

Outbound:

Ensure RDGW can connect to 192.168.0.10 on port 3389

🧪 Step 9: Test RDP via RD Gateway (from client)
On a remote client:

Open MSTSC

In Show Options > Advanced > Settings:

RD Gateway: 138.X.X.X

Use your domain credentials (e.g., infra\testuser)

Back in General tab:

Computer: 192.168.0.10

✅ You should land on RDS01's desktop, tunneled via HTTPS (443)
