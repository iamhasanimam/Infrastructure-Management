# ESXi RDS Lab Architecture – Overview

This lab project simulates a **production-grade Remote Desktop Services (RDS) infrastructure** on a self-hosted **VMware ESXi environment**. It mimics real-world enterprise deployments where secure remote access, centralized identity management, load-balanced session hosting, and internal DNS are critical.

This architecture is ideal for:
- Practicing enterprise IT infrastructure roles
- Testing and validating RDS configurations
- Learning Active Directory integration and DNS flow
- Building a secure, segmented lab for Windows infrastructure

## Lab Summary

|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **ESXi Host**      | Bare-metal hypervisor running all Windows Server VMs           |
| **Internal vSwitch** | Secure backend communication among infra servers             |
| **Public NIC (vSwitch0)** | Provides internet access via RD Gateway                 |
| **Private NIC (vSwitch1)** | Isolates internal servers for secure RDS traffic      |

| VM Name       | IP Address    | Role                                | Notes                                      |
|---------------|---------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **DC01**      | 192.168.0.3   | Active Directory Domain Controller, DNS | Root of `infra.local` domain, core auth server  |
| **RDGW01**    | 192.168.0.1   | RD Gateway                          | Public-facing RDP access via HTTPS, dual NIC  |
| **RDCB01**    | 192.168.0.2   | RD Connection Broker                | Load balances user sessions across RDS hosts  |
| **RDS01**     | 192.168.0.4   | RD Session Host 1                   | Handles user sessions, joined to domain  |
| **RDS02**     | 192.168.0.5   | RD Session Host 2                   | Redundancy/load balancing for RDS         |
| **FS01**      | 192.168.0.6   | File Server / Utility VM            | Hosts tools, shared storage, or user profiles  |
| **DEDICATED** | 192.168.0.7   | Direct RDP VM (JumpBox)             | For test/staging, not part of RDS farm  |


## Infrastructure Roles Explained

### DC01 (Domain Controller + DNS)
- Hosts **Active Directory** for centralized identity/authentication.
- Provides **DNS resolution** for internal name lookups.
- Acts as the heart of the `infra.local` domain.

### RDGW01 (Remote Desktop Gateway)
- Provides secure RDP access via **HTTPS (port 443)** from the internet.
- Has **two NICs**:
  - External (vSwitch0) – connected to internet/public IP
  - Internal (vSwitch1) – communicates with internal infra (192.168.0.x)
- Configured with **NAT or port forwarding** (on external firewall or ESXi uplink)

### RDCB01 (Connection Broker)
- Tracks user sessions and ensures reconnection to the same host.
- Distributes RDP sessions across **RDS01** and **RDS02**.
- Can be used for **RD Web Access** and **high availability farms**.

### RDS01 / RDS02 (Session Hosts)
- Deliver **RemoteApps** or **full desktop sessions** to users.
- Joined to the domain and added to the **RD Farm**.
- Use **FS01** for shared profile storage (if configured).

### FS01 (File Server)
- Optional server for:
  - Hosting **user profile folders (Roaming Profiles / FSLogix)**
  - **ISO/Tool** sharing
  - General storage or admin use

### Dedicated VM
- Not part of the RDS farm.
- Used for **direct RDP testing**, **jumpbox access**, or **external apps**.
- Can simulate user endpoints or host security tools.


## Key Features & Learnings

-  **Active Directory Integration**: All infra VMs joined to the `infra.local` domain.
-  **Internal DNS**: Name resolution via DC01, with static A records configured.
-  **Segregated Network**:
  - Internal vSwitch for infra communication (no internet)
  - External vSwitch for RD Gateway and internet-bound traffic
-  **Load Balanced Sessions**: RDCB01 ensures high availability and smart user routing.
-  **Secure Remote Access**: RDP tunneled through HTTPS using RD Gateway.
-  **Realistic Enterprise Setup**: Mirrors real IT infrastructures in MSPs, SMBs, or secure orgs.


##  Use Cases

-  **Lab Testing**: Safe sandbox for RDS scenarios
-  **Interview Prep**: Demo real-world enterprise architecture
-  **PoC for MSPs**: Validates isolated remote desktop environments
-  **Learning Hub**: Hands-on for Active Directory, DNS, RDP, Gateway setup


##  Future Enhancements (Optional)

-  Add **FSLogix** for profile containerization  
-  Integrate **Let's Encrypt SSL** for RD Gateway  
-  Implement **NPS & MFA** on RDGW01 for conditional access  
-  Setup **Monitoring Tools** (e.g., ManageEngine, PRTG)  
-  Build **PowerShell scripts** for automated join/config  


## ✅ Conclusion

This **ESXi-based RDS lab** is a compact yet powerful replica of what real-world organizations deploy for secure desktop delivery. Whether you're practicing for interviews, building internal infra, or just love clean architecture — this setup offers the ideal ground to master:

- RDP flows
- Domain trust
- Network segmentation
- Role-based server design
