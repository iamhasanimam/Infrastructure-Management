### WSUS‑Based Patch Management Workflow (Example)

If you already have a Windows Server and Active Directory:

Install WSUS on a dedicated or existing Windows Server.

Sync WSUS with Microsoft Update (configure update categories: Windows Server, Windows 10/11, .NET, SQL Server, etc.).

Create Computer Groups in WSUS:

Test

Pilot

Production

Link Groups to AD OUs using Group Policy.

Approve Patches in Stages:

Week 1: Approve for Test Group → Monitor for breakage.

Week 2: Approve for Pilot Group (subset of production machines).

Week 3: Approve for Production.

Automate Install & Reboot via GPO or scheduled tasks.

Generate Reports for compliance tracking.
