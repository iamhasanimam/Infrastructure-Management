## What is a Switch? (The Core)

A switch is a Layer 2 device that connects devices on a Local Area Network (LAN) and forwards Ethernet frames based on MAC addresses, not IP addresses.

Step 1: Initialization
When a switch is powered on:

It has no idea who is connected to which port

The MAC address table is empty


#### Scenario
VM1 → MAC = AA:AA:AA:AA:AA:AA, IP = 192.168.10.11

VM2 → MAC = BB:BB:BB:BB:BB:BB, IP = 192.168.10.12

Both on same subnet

Connected to vSwitch1

Step 0: You Type ping 192.168.10.12 in VM1
OS resolves: “Hmm, I don’t know the MAC for 192.168.10.12”

Sends an ARP broadcast (Layer 2 broadcast)

``` 
Who has 192.168.10.12? Tell 192.168.10.11 
```
