I chose the below configuartion 
- CPU : intel Core i7
- RAM : 4 * 16 
- SSD : 2 * 512


You would get the server delivered to you and you can access the server here : https://robot.hetzner.com/server

We would need to go to Support to raise KVM attached to your server so that you can access KVM console and mount Vmware Esxi ISO on top if it

In the meantime download Vmware Esxi ISO here : https://www.vmware.com/products/cloud-infrastructure/vsphere

---

Once you have raised the request, you would get the email with id and password within 1-2 hour to login to KVM console

You would get public ip address to access the Vmware Esxi, it's the same public ip assigned to your physical server.
